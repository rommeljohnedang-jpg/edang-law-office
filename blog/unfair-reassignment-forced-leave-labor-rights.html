          <h1>Unfair Reassignment and Forced Leave: Know Your Rights as an Employee Under Philippine Law</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-article-content">

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Being reassigned to a different work station or position can feel unsettling, especially when it comes without explanation or written notice. And being told not to report to work on certain days — even when work is available and other employees are allowed to come in — can be even more frustrating, particularly when it means losing income or being forced to use your leave credits.</p>
          <p>These situations raise important questions about the limits of management prerogative and the protections afforded to employees under Philippine labor law. This article explains when a reassignment or scheduling decision crosses the line from a lawful exercise of authority to a potential violation of your rights.</p>

          <h2>Management Prerogative: What Employers Can and Cannot Do</h2>
          <p>Philippine law recognizes that employers have the right to manage their business operations. This includes the power to transfer, reassign, or restructure the work assignments of their employees. This is known as <strong>management prerogative</strong> — the inherent right of an employer to regulate all aspects of employment, including work assignments, working methods, and the place and manner of work.</p>
          <p>However, management prerogative is not absolute. The Supreme Court of the Philippines has consistently held that the exercise of this right must meet the following conditions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Good faith.</strong> The reassignment must be motivated by a legitimate business reason, not by personal bias, retaliation, or an intent to force the employee to resign.</li>
            <li><strong>No demotion in rank.</strong> The new assignment must not result in a lower position or diminished status.</li>
            <li><strong>No diminution of pay, benefits, or earning opportunities.</strong> Under <strong>Article 100 of the Labor Code</strong> (Non-Diminution of Benefits), an employer cannot reduce the salary, benefits, or privileges that an employee has been receiving. This extends to earning opportunities — if a reassignment results in significantly lower income or fewer work hours, it may be considered unlawful.</li>
            <li><strong>Not unreasonable, inconvenient, or prejudicial.</strong> A transfer that causes unnecessary hardship — such as moving an employee to a far-flung location without justification — may be struck down.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If any of these conditions are not met, the reassignment is not a valid exercise of management prerogative. Instead, it may be considered a <strong>constructive dismissal</strong> — a situation where the employer's actions are so unfair or intolerable that the employee is effectively forced out of employment.</p>

          <h2>When Reassignment Becomes Constructive Dismissal</h2>
          <p>Constructive dismissal does not require that the employee is formally terminated. It occurs when the employer's conduct makes it impossible or unreasonable for the employee to continue working. The Supreme Court has recognized the following as indicators of constructive dismissal:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Transfer to a position with significantly less pay or responsibilities</li>
            <li>Reassignment designed to humiliate, harass, or isolate the employee</li>
            <li>Removal of work functions without justification</li>
            <li>Reduction of working hours or earning opportunities without valid cause</li>
            <li>Reassignment made in retaliation for asserting one's rights, joining a union, or filing a complaint</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The key test, as stated by the Supreme Court, is whether the transfer is unreasonable, inconvenient, or prejudicial to the employee. If the answer is yes, the reassignment is not a legitimate business decision — it is constructive dismissal.</p>

          <h2>Being Barred from Work on Days When Work Exists</h2>
          <p>A particularly troubling situation arises when an employee is told not to report for work on certain days — such as school holidays or "no class" days in educational institutions — even though work is still available and other employees are permitted to work. This kind of selective exclusion raises serious labor law concerns, especially when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Casual or contractual employees are allowed to work</strong> on the same days, while a regular or long-tenured employee is barred without any written policy or objective criteria.</li>
            <li><strong>The employee is forced to use leave credits</strong> — not because of personal absence, illness, or any fault of the employee, but solely because management disallows them from reporting.</li>
            <li><strong>No written policy, memorandum, or objective scheduling criteria</strong> is provided to justify the exclusion.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Under Philippine labor law, this type of selective exclusion may constitute:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Discriminatory scheduling.</strong> If there is no clear, written, and consistently applied policy for determining who works and who does not on certain days, management's decision to exclude a specific employee while allowing others to work may be considered arbitrary and discriminatory.</li>
            <li><strong>Diminution of benefits or earning opportunities.</strong> If the employee loses income or is forced to exhaust leave credits due to the employer's scheduling decisions rather than the employee's own choice, this may violate Article 100 of the Labor Code.</li>
            <li><strong>An element of constructive dismissal.</strong> If the pattern is persistent and results in substantial economic harm — such as a significant reduction in take-home pay over time — it may form part of a constructive dismissal claim, especially if combined with other adverse actions like a questionable reassignment.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Forced Use of Leave Credits: Is It Legal?</h2>
          <p>Leave credits are a benefit that belong to the employee. While employers may establish policies regarding the scheduling or approval of leave, compelling an employee to consume their leave credits solely because management has decided to bar them from working — when work is available — is a suspect practice under labor law.</p>
          <p>The critical distinction is this: if an employee voluntarily requests leave, the employer may approve or deny it under established company policy. But if the employer unilaterally prevents the employee from reporting and then requires the employee to charge the absence against their leave credits, the situation is fundamentally different. The employee is not absent by choice — the employer is creating the absence.</p>
          <p>In such cases, the affected employee may have grounds to demand:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Recrediting of leave credits</strong> that were used involuntarily</li>
            <li><strong>Payment of wages</strong> for the days the employee was ready, willing, and able to work but was prevented from doing so</li>
            <li><strong>A written explanation</strong> from the employer detailing the policy basis for the exclusion</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What Evidence Should You Gather?</h2>
          <p>If you believe you are being unfairly reassigned or selectively excluded from work, it is important to document everything. Key pieces of evidence include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Daily Time Records (DTR) or biometric logs</strong> showing your attendance before and after the scheduling changes</li>
            <li><strong>Leave applications</strong> that you were forced to file on days you were barred from reporting</li>
            <li><strong>Payslips</strong> showing reduced earnings during the affected periods</li>
            <li><strong>Text messages, group chats, or written instructions</strong> from management directing you not to report</li>
            <li><strong>Proof that other employees were allowed to work</strong> on the same days (schedules, logbooks, witness statements, photos)</li>
            <li><strong>Any documents related to your reassignment</strong> (memo, notice, verbal instruction documented in writing)</li>
            <li><strong>The company's employee handbook or scheduling policy</strong> — or evidence that no such written policy exists</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
          <p>If you are experiencing unfair reassignment or selective exclusion from work, there are several steps you can take:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Request a written explanation.</strong> Send a polite but formal written letter to your employer or supervisor asking for the specific reasons and policy basis for the reassignment or exclusion. Keep a copy with proof of receipt.</li>
            <li><strong>File a complaint with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).</strong> You may seek assistance from the nearest DOLE field office. DOLE provides a mandatory conciliation-mediation process to help resolve labor disputes before they escalate to formal litigation.</li>
            <li><strong>File a complaint with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).</strong> If the dispute is not resolved through conciliation, or if the employer's actions worsen or constitute constructive dismissal, you may file a formal complaint with the NLRC for illegal dismissal and money claims.</li>
            <li><strong>Consult a labor lawyer.</strong> An attorney experienced in labor law can evaluate your situation, help you gather the right evidence, and advise you on the best course of action based on the specific facts of your case.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Employers have the right to reassign employees, but this right is not unlimited — it must be exercised in good faith and must not result in demotion, diminution of pay or benefits, or reduced earning opportunities.</li>
            <li>Selectively barring an employee from work on days when work is available — especially while allowing other employees to work — may constitute discriminatory scheduling and a violation of labor law.</li>
            <li>Forcing an employee to use leave credits because management disallows them from reporting is a suspect practice that may require justification from the employer.</li>
            <li>If the pattern of unfair treatment is persistent and causes substantial economic harm, it may support a claim for constructive dismissal.</li>
            <li>Documentation is critical. Keep records of everything — attendance, payslips, communications, and scheduling decisions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h1>You Lent Your Credit Card for a Business Arrangement &mdash; Now They Won&rsquo;t Pay. What Are Your Legal Options?</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="blog-article-content">

          <p>It starts innocently enough. A friend, a relative, or a business acquaintance approaches you with a proposal: let them use your credit card to purchase goods &mdash; phones, appliances, gadgets, clothing &mdash; which they will resell at a profit. In return, they promise to pay you back the full amount charged to your card, plus a share of the profits or an agreed-upon interest. The terms are discussed over Messenger, text messages, or Viber. No formal contract is signed. You trust the person, so you agree.</p>
          <p>Weeks and months pass. The credit card bills arrive, and you are the one paying. The other party gives excuses, delays, and eventually stops responding altogether. You are now stuck with a growing debt, and the person who made the arrangement is nowhere to be found.</p>
          <p>This scenario is far more common than most people realize. In our practice here in Guimaras, we have seen variations of this story many times &mdash; and the legal consequences for the person who refuses to pay are serious.</p>

          <h2>Why This Is Not Just a &ldquo;Simple Debt&rdquo;</h2>

          <p>Many people &mdash; including, unfortunately, the ones who refuse to pay &mdash; dismiss this kind of arrangement as a purely private matter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just utang,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go to jail for debt.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>That last statement is technically correct: the 1987 Constitution provides that no person shall be imprisoned for debt. But the key distinction is this: when the non-payment is accompanied by fraud, deceit, or abuse of confidence, the matter is no longer a simple collection case. It becomes a criminal offense.</p>

          <h2>Estafa Under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code</h2>

          <p>The Revised Penal Code defines estafa &mdash; or swindling &mdash; as a crime involving deceit or abuse of confidence that causes damage to another person. It is punished under Article 315 in several modes, but two are especially relevant to credit card lending arrangements.</p>

          <h3>Estafa by Abuse of Confidence (Article 315, Par. 1(b))</h3>
          <p>This applies when a person receives money, goods, or any other personal property in trust, or under an obligation to deliver or return the same, and instead misappropriates or converts it to their own use, to the prejudice of the owner. In a credit card arrangement, your credit line is essentially extended to the other party on the understanding that they will pay you back. When they fail or refuse to do so, having already benefited from the goods purchased using your card, the elements of this mode of estafa may be satisfied.</p>

          <h3>Estafa by Means of Deceit (Article 315, Par. 2(a))</h3>
          <p>This covers situations where a person defrauds another through false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneous with the fraud. If the other party entered into the arrangement with no genuine intention to pay &mdash; or made representations about profits, repayment timelines, or the viability of the reselling business that turned out to be false &mdash; this mode of estafa may apply.</p>

          <p>The penalties for estafa are graduated based on the amount of damage. Under Republic Act No. 10951, which updated the threshold amounts, the penalty increases with the value of the fraud. For amounts exceeding Twenty Thousand Pesos (&#8369;20,000.00) but not exceeding Forty Thousand Pesos (&#8369;40,000.00), the penalty is <em>arresto mayor</em> in its maximum period to <em>prisi&oacute;n correccional</em> in its minimum period. For larger amounts, the penalty escalates accordingly, potentially reaching <em>prisi&oacute;n mayor</em> or even <em>reclusi&oacute;n temporal</em> for fraud involving hundreds of thousands or millions of pesos.</p>

          <h2>Civil Liability: Breach of Obligation</h2>

          <p>Even if the criminal elements are difficult to establish &mdash; for instance, if the other party genuinely intended to pay but simply ran out of money &mdash; you still have a civil cause of action.</p>
          <p>Under Article 1157 of the Civil Code, obligations arise from law, contracts, quasi-contracts, acts or omissions punished by law, and quasi-delicts. A credit card lending arrangement, even if undocumented by a formal written contract, constitutes an obligation. The agreement to pay back the amount charged to the card &mdash; with or without interest &mdash; creates a debtor-creditor relationship that is enforceable in court.</p>
          <p>Under Article 1159, obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties and should be complied with in good faith. And under Article 1169, a debtor incurs delay from the time the obligee judicially or extrajudicially demands fulfillment of the obligation. This is why sending a formal demand letter is a critical first step.</p>
          <p>You may recover actual damages (the amount charged to the credit card plus any interest and penalties incurred), moral damages if the non-payment caused anxiety, sleepless nights, or social humiliation, and attorney&rsquo;s fees.</p>

          <h2>The Access Devices Regulation Act (R.A. 8484)</h2>

          <p>In certain situations, the credit card arrangement may also implicate Republic Act No. 8484, the Access Devices Regulation Act. This law penalizes, among other things, the use of a credit card &mdash; which is classified as an &ldquo;access device&rdquo; &mdash; with intent to defraud. If the other party used your credit card details beyond the scope of what was agreed upon, made unauthorized purchases, or exceeded the agreed limits, criminal liability under R.A. 8484 may arise separately from estafa.</p>

          <h2>Your Messenger Conversations Are Evidence &mdash; And They Matter</h2>

          <p>One of the most important things about this type of case is that even though there is no formal written contract, the arrangement is often documented in detail through text messages, Facebook Messenger conversations, or Viber chats. These conversations &mdash; where the terms are discussed, the arrangement is agreed upon, the purchases are confirmed, and the promises to pay are made &mdash; are powerful evidence.</p>
          <p>Under the Rules on Electronic Evidence (A.M. No. 01-7-01-SC) and Republic Act No. 8792, the Electronic Commerce Act, electronic documents &mdash; including chat messages, text messages, and emails &mdash; are admissible as evidence in Philippine courts, provided they are properly authenticated.</p>
          <p>The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed this. In <em>People v. Rodriguez</em> (G.R. No. 263603, October 9, 2023), the Court ruled that online chat logs and videos used as evidence do not violate the right to privacy when they are used to determine whether a crime has been committed. The Court explained that the Data Privacy Act itself allows the processing of personal information when it relates to the determination of criminal liability or the protection of lawful rights in court proceedings.</p>
          <p>Earlier, in <em>Cadajas v. People</em>, the Supreme Court held that photos and messages obtained from a Facebook Messenger account by a private individual are admissible as evidence. The Court reasoned that the constitutional right to privacy was designed to protect against government intrusion, not against private individuals who lawfully obtained the communications.</p>
          <p>For the purposes of a credit card lending case, this means that the screenshots and records of your Messenger conversations &mdash; showing the agreement, the purchases made, the amounts owed, and the promises to repay &mdash; can and should be presented as evidence. These conversations can establish the existence of the obligation, the terms of the arrangement, the demand for payment, and the other party&rsquo;s refusal or failure to comply.</p>

          <h2>How to Preserve Your Evidence</h2>

          <p>If you are in this situation, here is what you need to do immediately.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Do not delete any messages.</strong> Preserve the entire conversation thread, including messages from both sides. Do not edit, crop, or selectively screenshot.</li>
            <li><strong>Take complete screenshots.</strong> Each screenshot should clearly show the sender&rsquo;s name or profile, the date and time of the messages, and the full content of the conversation. If the conversation is long, take sequential screenshots that show continuity.</li>
            <li><strong>Screen-record the conversation.</strong> Using your phone&rsquo;s built-in screen recording feature, scroll through the entire Messenger thread from beginning to end. This creates a continuous visual record that is harder to challenge than isolated screenshots.</li>
            <li><strong>Save the conversation in its original format.</strong> Facebook Messenger allows you to download your data, including message history. Do this as a backup. If the other party deletes their account or unsends messages, your downloaded copy will still contain the original conversation.</li>
            <li><strong>Keep your credit card statements.</strong> These are your documentary proof of the actual amounts charged. Match them against the conversations where specific purchases were discussed.</li>
            <li><strong>Send a formal demand letter.</strong> Before filing any case, a written demand &mdash; preferably through a lawyer &mdash; puts the other party on notice and establishes that you have made a formal claim. Their failure to respond or comply after receiving the demand strengthens both your civil and criminal case.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>A Word About Interest</h2>

          <p>Many credit card lending arrangements include an agreement on interest &mdash; the card owner charges the borrower a markup on top of the actual purchase price. If the agreed interest rate is documented in the Messenger conversations, it forms part of the obligation. However, if the interest rate is excessive, courts may reduce it to a reasonable level under prevailing jurisprudence. The Supreme Court has consistently held that interest rates that are unconscionable may be equitably reduced, even if previously agreed upon by the parties.</p>
          <p>This does not defeat the case &mdash; it simply means that the court may adjust the amount recoverable. The principal obligation to pay remains enforceable.</p>

          <h2>What Your Options Are</h2>

          <p>Depending on the facts, a person in this situation may pursue one or more of the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A <strong>criminal complaint for estafa</strong> filed with the Office of the City or Provincial Prosecutor, supported by a complaint-affidavit and the Messenger evidence.</li>
            <li>A <strong>civil action for sum of money and damages</strong> filed before the appropriate court.</li>
            <li>A <strong>small claims case</strong> if the total amount sought does not exceed Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (&#8369;400,000.00), which is the current jurisdictional threshold for small claims under the Revised Rules on Small Claims Cases (A.M. No. 08-8-7-SC, as amended).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Small claims cases are particularly attractive because they do not require a lawyer to represent you in court, are decided quickly, and cannot be appealed. However, they are limited to money claims and do not address criminal liability.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>Lending your credit card to someone for a business arrangement is, at its core, an act of trust. When that trust is broken, the law provides remedies &mdash; both civil and criminal. The absence of a formal written contract does not leave you without recourse. Your Messenger conversations, text messages, and credit card statements form the backbone of your case.</p>
          <p>If you find yourself in this situation, the most important thing is to act promptly, preserve your evidence, and seek proper legal advice.</p>

              <span>What is the difference between annulment and declaration of nullity in the Philippines?</span>
              <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><path d="M6 9l6 6 6-6"/></svg>
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Annulment and declaration of nullity are two different legal remedies under Philippine family law. Annulment applies to marriages that are voidable — meaning they were valid at the time of celebration but can be annulled due to specific grounds such as lack of parental consent, insanity, fraud, force or intimidation, or physical incapacity. Declaration of nullity, on the other hand, applies to marriages that are void from the beginning, such as those involving psychological incapacity under Article 36 of the Family Code. Both require filing a petition in court and undergoing trial.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The annulment process in the Philippines typically takes one to three years, depending on factors such as the court's schedule, the complexity of the case, the cooperation of both parties, and whether the case is contested. The process includes filing the petition, the Office of the Solicitor General's involvement, psychological evaluation, court hearings, and the issuance of a decision. We guide clients through every step of this process.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Psychological incapacity, under Article 36 of the Family Code, refers to a party's inability to comply with the essential marital obligations. The Supreme Court of the Philippines has ruled that this must be characterized by gravity, juridical antecedence (existing before the marriage), and incurability. A psychological evaluation is typically required as part of the evidence. Recent jurisprudence, particularly the Tan-Andal ruling, has broadened the interpretation of this ground.</p>

              <p>Bail is generally a matter of right for offenses not punishable by death, reclusion perpetua, or life imprisonment before conviction. For capital offenses, bail is discretionary and depends on the strength of the evidence against the accused. We can assist with filing a bail petition and representing you at bail hearings to help secure your temporary liberty while the case is pending.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Illegal dismissal occurs when an employer terminates an employee without just cause or authorized cause, or fails to observe proper due process (notice and hearing requirements). Under Philippine labor law, an illegally dismissed employee may be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights, full back wages, and other benefits. If reinstatement is no longer feasible, separation pay may be awarded instead.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>To file a labor complaint, you first need to determine whether it falls under the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) or the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). Cases involving illegal dismissal and monetary claims exceeding a certain threshold are filed with the NLRC, while labor standards violations and smaller claims go to DOLE. We can help you prepare and file the appropriate complaint and represent you throughout the proceedings.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Under the Labor Code of the Philippines, employees are entitled to receive their wages on time and in full. This includes regular wages, overtime pay, holiday pay, 13th month pay, and other legally mandated benefits. If your employer fails to pay these, you may file a complaint with the DOLE or NLRC. The law also provides for penalties against employers who willfully withhold wages.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Transferring a land title involves several steps: executing a Deed of Absolute Sale or appropriate conveyance document, paying capital gains tax and documentary stamp tax at the BIR, obtaining a Certificate Authorizing Registration (CAR), paying transfer tax at the local Treasurer's office, and registering the transfer at the Register of Deeds. We can handle the entire process to ensure that the transfer is properly documented and legally valid.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>An extrajudicial settlement of estate is a legal process where the heirs of a deceased person agree to divide the estate among themselves without going to court. This is allowed under Rule 74 of the Rules of Court when the deceased left no will, has no outstanding debts, and all heirs are of legal age and agree to the partition. The settlement must be published in a newspaper of general circulation once a week for three consecutive weeks and filed with the Register of Deeds.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>An ejectment case is a summary proceeding filed to recover possession of a property. There are two types: forcible entry (when someone occupies your property by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth) and unlawful detainer (when a person's right to possess the property has expired, such as after lease termination). These cases must be filed within one year from the date of unlawful entry or the last demand to vacate, respectively, at the Municipal Trial Court.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>To collect a debt, you typically start by sending a formal demand letter to the debtor. If the debtor does not pay, you may file a collection case (sum of money) in the appropriate court. For claims not exceeding a certain threshold, the case may be filed under the Rules of Procedure for Small Claims, which provides a faster and more simplified process without the need for a lawyer during hearings. We can advise you on the best approach based on the amount and circumstances of the debt.</p>
